# Lector

**Lector** is a Ruby gem written specifically for my high school's Moodle site. It can login as a student and then web scrape info on staff, teachers, students, and courses.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'lector'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install lector

## Usage

Documentation can be found at TODO: LINK 

## Development

I still don't know much about real development of Ruby gems so if you want to contribute just clone, edit, and submit a pull request.
